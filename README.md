# 🌤️ End-to-End ETL Pipeline Using Apache Airflow and Astro
This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using Apache Airflow and Astro CLI, designed to extract current weather data from the Open-Meteo API, transform it, and load it into a PostgreSQL database.

🚀 Project Overview
The pipeline consists of three main steps:
## . Extract: Fetches real-time weather data for London using the Open-Meteo API.
## . Transform: Processes and cleans the raw data to a structured format.
## .Load: Inserts the processed data into a PostgreSQL database for storage and future analysis.

This ETL pipeline is scheduled to run daily using Airflow’s scheduling system.
